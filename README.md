# MemoryLeakDemo
Demo project for my memory leak talks

This is a demo project that I use for my memory leak talks. It demonstrates five memory leaks. Every leak is 
implemented in on of the Demo Windows (Demo1Windows - Demo5Window).

There is a short description and a commented solution in every file.
